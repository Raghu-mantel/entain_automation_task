Bit more depth here but he should roll forward and take catching again. AZTEC STATE (6) was just fair first up in a 3yo Bm70 at Sandown-Lakeside but is better suited to this trip and showed plenty of promise last time in. Looks a strong chance. HEAVENLY EAGLE (8) won well last start at Yarra Valley and can improve again fitness-wise. Can figure at odds. GWAN SO (1) is going well and will find this a touch easier than recent runs. HIGH FIVE (10) won easily first up and can figure.",

Has definite claims. GOING SOLO (2) has been mixing form lately, hitting the frame two back before finishing fifth (30.26) at Dubbo in a Grade 5. Can turn it around this time.

CITY ROCKSTAR (7) has been very consistent of late, continuing a string of wins and placings when she scored at her latest appearance at Geelong, getting home by a neck. Going well and is capable of testing her rivals. HEAVENLY BRIGADE (2) didn't do a bad job when fourth at Melton last time out and draws to advantage.

He will find things easier in the country and will relish the step up to a mile. This is the right race for him and he is overdue for his first victory. MYSTERY BULLET (6) is a stablemate of the top pick who has resumed with a couple of tough runs for fourth to open this campaign on both of the Pinjarra courses. He will appreciate the extra furlong and will also be spot-on with his fitness third up. Hard to beat from a handy gate. LE GRAND JEU (3) ran his best race this prep when resuming for second at York. He is back at that level here and can bounce back into the money. Each-way value. STRUCK BY LUCK (5) has the blinkers on last start and ran the race of an improver when finishing runner-up here 10 days ago. He is drawn to lead early on and could take them all of the way this time.",
